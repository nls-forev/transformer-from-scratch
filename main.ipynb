    "So you’ve heard about Transformers but have no idea how to build them from scratch?  \n",
    "Tried reading the paper but got lost in all the math and jargon? Don’t worry — you’re not alone!\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository is your **step-by-step guide** to implementing the Transformer architecture from scratch using **PyTorch** (or even TensorFlow if you prefer).  \n",
    "We’ll go **module by module**, breaking everything down into simple, beginner-friendly concepts.\n",

    "## 🎯 What’s the Goal?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal is **not just to copy** a Transformer implementation, but to **understand how it works** so that you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🛠️ Build your own Transformer from scratch  \n",
    "- 🔧 Fine-tune models for tasks like binary classification, machine translation, etc.  \n",
    "- 🧪 Modify or extend the architecture (like building GPT-style models!)  \n",
    "- 📖 Read and understand modern research papers better  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positional encoding (and why it’s needed)\n",
    "- Self-attention and multi-head attention\n",
    "- The full encoder-decoder architecture\n",
    "- Layer normalization, residual connections, masking, and more\n",
